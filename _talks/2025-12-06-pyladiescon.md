Communication has long been a necessary skill for data professionals, but most folks stop with simply data visualization and data storytelling. 

As a former marketing and PR manager, my seemingly “unrelated” experience has been a huge asset to my career in analytics and data science. 

We all know how to craft a story with data and create a compelling visualization. But what about ... 
* How to craft the story of the value of your team and build trust?
* How to create a compelling business case for your projects?
* How to get buy-in and communicate impact?

PR is necessary for data teams, even if it’s just internal. 
* Does the rest of the company know who you are?
* Does your team have a good reputation?
* Are you trusted advisors?
* Do you have evangelists who tell your stories for you? 

In this talk, I will share lessons from my previous career in public relations and marketing and how they apply to your work as a data professional.
