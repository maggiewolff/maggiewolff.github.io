Interviewed on The Joe Reis Podcast. 

The days of easy entry into data jobs over. Maggie Wolff joins the show to discuss the new reality of the data career landscape. We dive into why the bar is higher than ever and why "cold DMing" on LinkedIn is a terrible strategy.

Maggie also breaks down her secret strategy for networking as an introvert: treating events like a game or role-playing a more extroverted friend. Plus, we discuss the rise of AI in education, the problem with "lazy" learning , and why companies replacing humans with AI are making a mistake.
