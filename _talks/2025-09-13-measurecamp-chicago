Communication has long been a necessary skill for data professionals, but most folks stop with simply data visualization and data storytelling. 

As a former marketing and PR manager, my seemingly “unrelated” experience has been a huge asset to my career in analytics and data science. We all know how to craft a story with data and create a compelling visualization. But do you know how to craft a story that delivers value to your company? How to build trust to get buy-in? How to create more visibility for your work? 

PR is necessary for data teams, even if it’s just internal. Does the rest of the company know who you are? Does your team have a good reputation? Are you trusted advisors? Do you have evangelists who tell your stories for you? 

In this talk, I share how lessons from my previous career in public relations and marketing can be applied to your work as a data professional.
