About Me
======
I'm a data scientist in the tech industry, focused on e-commerce, customer success, and product adoption. My work spans advanced analysis, A/B testing, and predictive modeling — including recent research on the impact of [user effort on business outcomes](https://youtu.be/ApK1z6m9Zk0?si=RhjkAfoAFkNfyZE6).

I hold an MS in Data Science and a BA in Communication, a combination that shapes how I work: I'm as invested in translating complex findings for stakeholders as I am in the analysis itself. My path to data wasn't linear — [I started in marketing and PR](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/my-journey-from-marketing-to-data-science-6611bac42480) before gravitating toward analytics roles, and I think that background makes me a stronger collaborator and communicator. I bring a lot of my [PR mindset into my analytics work](https://youtu.be/fGWRp16p7sE?si=5NS5a10_70ERmnrB). 

Outside of work, I'm an ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Chicago](https://widschicago.org/), an organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://chicago.measurecamp.org/), and host a [podcast](/posts/) featuring conversations with other data professionals.
