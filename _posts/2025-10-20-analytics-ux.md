I talk with Rahma, a product researcher, about how to use analytics to understand the user experience as well as how to pivot into analytics from another role.

We discussed:
* How to contribute to sales-driven data problems when you come from a more academic and research background, especially when B2B metrics can be vague and overwhelming.
* Solutions to common UX problems like friction and churn.
* How to lean into a different background when trying to transition to analytics and market yourself as a uniquely qualified candidate.
* The most important skills for breaking into analytics.
* How to make your portfolio projects more impactful.
