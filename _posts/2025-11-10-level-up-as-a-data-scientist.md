In this episode, I chat with Mark, a fellow data scientist, to answer questions about career development and the real-world practice of data science.

We discussed:
* The value of a master’s degree in data science
* Mentorship and career coaching
* How data science teams identify work to do
* Communication and collaboration with business stakeholders
* Differences between analytics and data science roles
* Managing large vs. small projects
* Career-defining projects and demonstrating impact
* Measuring business value beyond accuracy
* Lessons learned and what I would do differently in my career
* The importance of communication and asking for help
* Returning to marketing analytics and finding satisfaction in hybrid roles

Key Takeaways
* A master’s program provides structure, credentials, and connections — but isn’t the only path.
* Mentorship and coaching accelerate growth and confidence.
* Great data scientists co-create with the business — not just deliver outputs.
* Communication is a superpower; it amplifies technical work.
* The most valued projects are those that clearly improve business outcomes.
* Career pivots and non-linear paths can become your greatest asset.
